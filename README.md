# Weather App

## Planning

This should be a Single Page Application, that pulls weather information from a
public API and displays it for the user.

### Features

- [ ] Search (with autocomplete)
- [ ] Preference Settings
  - [ ] Celsius / Fahrenheit
  - [ ] Kilometers / Miles
- [ ] Day View
- [ ] Forecast View
- [ ] Location Tabs

## Main Libraries and Frameworks

- **React & Typescript** to keep things modular and type-safe.
- **Vite** for quick and easy compiling of the app during development. Stable
and stays out of the way, with optional plugins if needed.
- **Tanstack Query** to cache the API's data client-side and manage updates to
the data.
